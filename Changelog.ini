- Use File::Slurper's read_binary() for testing rather than its read_text(). This should help
with the test failures under MS Windows.

- Testing using the new SVG 2.82. All ok. So edit data/synopsis.svg to fiddle whitespace, and
retest. All ok. Thanx to Mohammad S Anwar for the work on SVG.

[V 1.06]
Date=2017-08-15T08:39:00

some time ago. Thanx to Kevin Mulholland for noticing.

[V 1.05]
Date=2017-08-11T17:10:05
Comments= <<EOT
- Add 'title' to the hash of options you can pass to image_link(), rectangle_line() and
text_link(). Note: This module uses keys named 'target' and 'title'. It passes these to the
SVG module as '-target' and '-title'.
- Update the docs to include 'title'.
- Update the FAQ to discuss Unicode and MouseOver. The latter is triggered by using 'title'.
- Chane the write() method to encode the output file as UTF-8. Then add 'use utf8' to
synopsis.pl and test.t.
- Update various demos to show the usage of 'title'.
EOT

[V 1.04]
Date=2017-04-22T11:52:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Patch t/test.t so that before comparing shipped SVG with generated one, zap within those
2 files the versions #s of the SVG modules which created the files. This is necessary
because I generated data/synopsis.svg with SVG V 2.64, but any version might be
installed on another machine. See #RT212178. Thanx to Slaven Rezic for the report.

[V 1.03]

Comments= <<EOT
- Stop using Test::Stream. Use Test::More shipped in the Test::Simple distro.
See RT#116932. Thanx to Chad Granum.
- Update version #s in pre-reqs.
- Adopt new repo structure. For details, see
http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html.
- Update .gitignore and MANIFEST.SKIP.
- Move File::Spec, File::Temp, Test::Pod and Test::Simple to TEST_REQUIRES within Makefile.PL.
- Change licence from Artistic to Perl.

[V 1.02]
Date=2016-03-21T13:44:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Patch image_link() to return the auto-generated id of the image element. Likewise,
rectangle_link() returns the id of the rectangle element and text_link() returns the id
of the text element.
- Patch t/test.t to clean up the string name of the test.
EOT

[V 1.01]
Date=2016-02-25T13:53:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- After I had a fight with github, git updated t/test.t to restore the obsolete name cell.svg
instead of synopsis.svg as the file to be compared to the output of the test, so the test
failed.
